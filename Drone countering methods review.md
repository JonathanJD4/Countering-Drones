# Review of methods for drone countering

## GPS Spoofing
This device sends a new signal to the drone, replacing the communication with GPS satellites it uses for navigation. In this way, the drone is ‘spoofed’ into thinking it’s somewhere else. By dynamically altering the GPS coordinates in real-time, the drone’s position can be controlled by the spoofer. Once control is gained the drone can be directed to a ‘safe zone’, for example.

* Pros: Medium cost, non-kinetic neutralisation.

* Cons: Short range, can affect (and jam) other radio communications. [1]

“By dynamically altering the GPS coordinates in real-time, the drone’s position can be controlled by the spoofer. Once control is gained the drone can be directed to a ‘safe zone’, for example.” [1]


“Proximity Spoofing Attack: the spoofer is few meters away from the target receiver.

Distant Spoofing Attack: the spoofer is at a non-negligible distance with a precise alignment of the counterfeit and authentic signals, which is only possible with a meter-level accurate suggested position.” [2]


## Signal Jamming

An RF Jammer is a static, mobile, or handheld device which transmits a large amount of RF energy towards the drone, masking the controller signal. This results in one of four scenarios, depending on the drone:

Drone makes a controlled landing in its current position
Drone returns to user-set home location (which could be set to a target position instead of home)
Drone falls uncontrolled to the ground
Drone flies off in a random uncontrolled direction. [1]
 
* Pros: Medium cost, non-kinetic neutralisation.

* Cons: Short range, can affect (and jam) other radio communications, can result in unpredictable drone behaviour, could unintentionally send the drone to its target. [1]

## Birds of prey
Eagles can be a low-tech solution but requires a lot of manpower for training (at least 1 year per bird) and for maintaining the birds of prey.
Low risk of collateral damage and very fast response although they require intensive training.
Counter drones – Drone Swarming

M. R. Brust, G. Danoy, D. H. Stolfi and P. Bouvry states that Figure 1 is 
“An Illustration of the self-organizing approach of the defence swarm from patrolling to the counter-attack. The basic elements used in the development of the algorithms: Branch, cluster head (CH), intruder (mUAV) and defender (dUAV)” [3]

## Nets/ Net gun
Firing a net at a drone, or otherwise bringing a net into contact with a drone stops the drone by prohibiting the rotor blades. There are three main types:

* Net Cannon fired from the ground: can be hand-held, shoulder-launched, or turret-mounted. Anywhere from 20m to 300m effectiveness. Can be used with or without a parachute for controlled descent of the captured drone.

* Net cannon fired from another drone: overcomes the limited range of a net cannon on the ground. Can be difficult to capture another moving drone. Normally used with a parachute for controlled descent of the captured drone.

* Hanging net deployed from a ‘net drone’. The drone is captured by manoeuvring the friendly net carrying drone towards the rogue drone. The ‘net drone’ will normally be capable of either carrying the rogue drone to a safe zone, or if it is too heavy, can release the captured drone with or without a parachute for controlled descent.
 
Pros: Physically captures drone – good for forensics and prosecution, ground-launched net cannons are semi-automatic with high accuracy, drone deployed nets have long range, low risk of collateral damage.

Cons: Kinetic solution could result in debris depending on parachute options, drone deployed nets imprecise and long reload time, ground-launched nets have a short range. [1]
