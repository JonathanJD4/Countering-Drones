# WiFi Apps comparision

All apps detect 2.4GHz and 5GHz

# Differences

               ##NetSpot   ##Net Analyzer ##WiFi Analyzer
*2.4 & 5GHz      Yes         Yes            Yes
*DNS lookup      No          Yes            No
*Network info    Yes         Yes            No
*Nearby APs      Yes         No             Yes
*CSV export      Yes         No             No
*Hidden WiFi     Yes         No             Yes
*Ping & Trace    No          Yes            No

To conclude NetSpot is the most useful app for the experiment carried out. Although each application has it own advantages, NetSpot has more variety especially with CSV export which the other 2 applications do not have this ability.

I would give; 
###Netspot - 8/10 (10 being the highest and 1 being the lowest)
###Net Analyzer - 6/10 (This is because it does have usefull tools but were not meant for the experiment
###WiFi Analyzer - 7/10 (Uncommon features such as view hidden WiFi's, which this can come as a advantage to find hidden 2.4GHZ signals)
