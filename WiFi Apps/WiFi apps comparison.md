To conclude NetSpot is the most useful app for the experiment carried out. Although each application has it own advantages, NetSpot has more variety especially with CSV export which the other 2 applications do not have this ability.

I would give; 
### Netspot 
- 8/10 (10 being the highest and 1 being the lowest)
### Net Analyzer 
- 6/10 (This is because it does have usefull tools but were not meant for the experiment
### WiFi Analyzer 
- 7/10 (Uncommon features such as view hidden WiFi's, which this can come as a advantage to find hidden 2.4GHZ signals)
