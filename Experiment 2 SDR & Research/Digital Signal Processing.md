# Digital Signal Processing

### What is it?

DSP manipulates different types of signals with the intention of filtering, measuring, or compressing and producing analogue signals.

### What it is used for?

DSP can be found in almost any field, whether it's oil processing, sound reproduction, radar and sonar, medical image processing, or telecommunications-- essentially any application in which signals are being compressed and reproduced. [1]

The digital signal process takes signals like audio, voice, video, temperature, or pressure that have already been digitized and then manipulates them mathematically. This information can then be represented as discrete time, discrete frequency, or other discrete forms so that the information can be digitally processed. An analogue-to-digital converter is needed in the real world to take analogue signals (sound, light, pressure, or temperature) and convert them into 0's and 1's for a digital format. [1]

### Components

A DSP contains four key components: 
* Computing Engine: Mathematical manipulations, calculations, and processes by accessing the program, or task, from the Program Memory and the information stored in the Data Memory.
* Data Memory: This stores the information to be processed and works hand in hand with program memory. 
* Program Memory: This stores the programs, or tasks, that the DSP will use to process, compress, or manipulate data.
* I/O: This can be used for various things, depending on the field DSP is being used for, i.e., external ports, serial ports, timers, and connecting to the outside world. [1]

### How

Signals need to be processed so that the information that they contain can be displayed, analysed, or converted to another type of signal that may be of use. In the real-world, analogue products detect signals such as sound, light, temperature, or pressure and manipulate them. Converters such as an Analog-to-Digital converter then take the real-world signal and turn it into the digital format of 1's and 0's. From here, the DSP takes over by capturing the digitized information and processing it. It then feeds the digitized information back for use in the real world. It does this in one of two ways, either digitally or in an analogue format by going through a Digital-to-Analog converter. All of this occurs at very high speeds. [2]
