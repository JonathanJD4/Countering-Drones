# Countering Drones

This project is based on detecting the presence of drones using software defined radio (commonly known as SDR) and choosing a method for countering drones which could be through SDR, Early warning system or GPS spoofing

### Pre-requisites

* PC/Laptop
* Background Research
* Summer Research
* GitLab
* Jira
* Mobile device (For testing)
* Software defined radio (SDR) Dongle & Antenna

### Installing
A step by step guide on how to build and install your software, for example:

* Download SDR software
* Install WiFi apps on mobile device to detect 2.4GHz signals
* NetSpot app
* Net Analyzer app
* WiFi Analyzer app
* SDR Sharp
* Compass


 
### Component Testing

* SDR Dongle
* SDR Antenna

### Experiments 
| Experiment 1 | Experiment 2 | Experiment 3 | Experiment 4 | Experiment 5 | Experiment 6 |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Testing for 2.4GHz WiFi signals indoors (Flat) & outdoors | SDR testing for 2.4GHz radio frequencies | Testing for 5GHz/5180MHz WiFi signal indoors | Testing for 2.4GHz/2412MHz WiFi signal indoors | Testing for 5GHz/5180MHz WiFi signal Outdoors | Testing for 2.4GHz/2412MHz WiFi signal Outdoors
| WiFi apps used - NetSpot, WiFi Analyzer, and Net Analyzer | SDR Sharp & Dongle used | Signal strength against location | NetSpot and WiFi Analyzer used | test the signal strength against the location | Once the signal reaches -100dBm the WiFi signal is no more viable and will not be able to connect or be discovered by the mobile device |
| Signal strength against location | 13cm ham band detected | Testing inside house (3 floors) | Has stronger range | signal strength is lost once the mobile device has reached the road | Garden has better signal strength |

#### Body block method experiments
| Experiment 7 | Experiment 8 |
| ------ | ------ |
| Outdoors experiment for 2.4GHz | Indoors experiment for 5GHz |
| Signal strength was stronger outdoors and had more range | Signal strength was stronger indoors but had less range |
| Signal loss minor | signal loss major |
