# Radion direction finding

## Research

Radio Direction Finding is used for many things such as
“
*	Military: such as the direction of a threat, the location and movement of enemy transmitters and the direction of enemy jammers.
*	Search and Rescue: the location of RF search and rescue beacons.
*	Science: the tracking of animals in their environment.
*	Radio monitoring: the location of sources of interference and of illicit transmitters” [1]

Britannica states that Radio direction finder, also known as Radio Compass/radio receiver and directional antenna system is

“Used to determine the direction of the source of a signal. It most often refers to a device used to check the position of a ship or aircraft, although it may also direct a craft’s course or be used for military or investigative purposes.” [2]

“The antenna, usually a loop antenna, rotates and pinpoints the direction from which a radio signal is strongest. This is the direction of the broadcasting station, the position of which is already known. Using the directions and positions of several radio stations, a navigator can use triangulation to determine the position of his craft. Corrections must, however, be made in the readings from the radio direction finder to account, for example, for the effect on radio transmissions of the craft’s magnetic field.” [2]
