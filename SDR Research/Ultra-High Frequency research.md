# Ultra High Frequency

The range for Ultra-High frequency ranges from 300MHz to 3GHz.
Techopedia states that “ The UHF radiations are least affected by environmental factors, that is why they are most commonly used for TV and radio transmission and channel broadcasting. They have strong directivity, but, at the same time, the receiving error increases.” [1]

In addition to this Techopedia also states that “The broadcast range (also called line of sight) of UHF is shorter than that of VHF, that is why boosters are used after a few hundred kilometres. UHF is used by cordless and two-way navigation, wireless local area networks, and communication, radio, and security systems. UHF radars are said to be effective at tracking stealth fighters but not stealth bombers.” [1]
